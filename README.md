# Project Happy Thoughts API

An api build in node.js with POST and GET request for an already excisting Frontend project

## The problem

First I watched some videos about POST and GET request, started with a code along and started to build the API. I hade some struggles with deploying it but manage to solve it to start from begging and created a new url at Google cloud.
